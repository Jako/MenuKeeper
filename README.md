# MenuKeeper

Keep the order of the manager menu after installing or updating an extra.

## Installation

MODX Package Management

## Usage

Just install the extra. It is active by default.

There are two menu entries available in the manage menu to manually save and
load the menu entry positions. If you manually edit the menu, you have to save
the menu afterwards with `Manage` -> `MenuKeeper` -> `Save`.
